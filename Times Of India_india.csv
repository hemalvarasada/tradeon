""Farmers from Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan and Bihar have made all preparations to move to Delhi for the march,"" Singh added. Meanwhile, Delhi Police has beefed up the security at the Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders, and railway and metro stations and bus stands in view of the farmers' protest march. The farmers also called for a four-hour countrywide 'rail roko' on March 10. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) national body has given a call for the Mahapanchayat in Delhi on March 14 to highlight issues of a legal guarantee of MSP, against the electricity amendment bill, freedom from debt, old age pension, rolling back of labour codes, and other pending issues. Giving a call to march to Delhi, the farmers have been camping at multiple points in areas bordering the national capital since February 13 along with their tractors, mini-vans, and pickup trucks, demanding, among others, a law guaranteeing MSP (minimum support price) and withdrawal of police cases against farmers during earlier protests. During the last round of talks, which ended past midnight on February 18, the panel of three Union ministers made an offer to buy five crops -- moong dal, urad dal, tur dal, maize, and cotton -- from farmers at MSP for five years through central agencies. However, the protesting farmers turned down the demand and returned to their protest sites.","Mar 6, 2024, 07:15 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"

The blast took place at the café during the busy lunch hour on March 1, injuring at least nine people. Earlier, the Bengaluru Police had filed a case under the rigorous Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Explosive Substances Act regarding the cafe explosion.

This is his second acquittal in the UAPA case in nearly 15 months after the previous verdict by another HC bench was stayed and subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court. Like it did on the previous occasion, Maharashtra immediately filed a special leave petition in SC for a stay. The division bench of Justices Vinay Joshi and Valmiki Menezes cited technical grounds for the acquittal of all six convicts , one of whom is dead. As in the October 2022 acquittal, the bench ruled that the prosecution failed to prove beyond doubt charges against 57-year-old Saibaba, who needs a wheelchair for mobility, and his co-accused. “The entire prosecution is vitiated on account of invalid sanction to prosecute accused for want of valid sanction in terms of Section 45(1) of UAPA...It failed to establish the seizure of incriminating material from the house of accused No 6 Saibaba. It also failed to prove electronic evidence in terms of provisions of the Indian Evidence Act and Information Technology Act,” states the verdict. Noting that various provisions of UAPA weren’t complied with, the judges said sanction to prosecute the accused was invalid. “Taking cognisance of the trial court’s judgment without valid sanction or no sanction to prosecute Saibaba is at the root of the case, which renders the entire proceedings null and void...The trial court proceedings amount to failure of justice.” The prosecution, led by special counsel Prashant Sathianathan and government pleader Deven Chauhan, made a verbal request to the judges to reserve their order for six weeks so that they could file a special leave petition in SC. The bench directed them to file an application, which was later rejected. Besides Saibaba, the five people acquitted in the case are Mahesh Kariman Tirki, Hem Keshavdatta Mishra, Prashant Rahi Narayan Sanglikar, Vijay Tirki and Pandu Pora Narote, who died of swine flu during the trial. Lawyers representing Saibaba and the other four in jail couldn’t immediately approach the sessions court for their release as the HC verdict hadn’t been uploaded online until late Tuesday. They have been in Nagpur’s Central Jail since their arrest in 2014. The March 7, 2017 ruling against Saibaba and five others was the first judgment in Maharashtra in which all the accused were convicted based on electronic evidence. While acquitting them in 2022, the division bench of Justices Rohit Deo and Anil Pansare quoted former home minister P Chidambaram, who had moved a bill in Lok Sabha to amend UAPA and suggested setting up an independent authority to review evidence to prosecute accused under the stringent law.","Mar 6, 2024, 10:09 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"

These findings are part of an exploratory research on ‘Enhancing Women Leadership in India Inc’ that focuses on the gaps and solutions to increase women’s participation in corporate India. The research conducted jointly by Fortune India and SP Jain Institute of Management and Research was supported by the women and child development ministry and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Top Picks For You French lawmakers enshrine access to abortion in constitution How Pakistani, Chinese hackers tried to attack Pran Pratistha event Congress to decide on LS candidates at CEC meet on Thursday According to the research, over 30-40% of women employees quit the workforce by the time they enter middle management. This is the time when they invariably get married or have a family. They take maternity leave and returning to work post childbirth gets challenging. The research recommends measures for “fixing the leaky pipeline – the broken rung -- and the glass ceiling will fix by itself”. It is suggested that organisations could set mandates for gender-specific hiring. It is also highlighted that organisations shy away from hiring women in mid-management roles as they know there could be a six-month ‘maternity leave’ in the offing. “It is paid leave and most organisations don’t want — smaller ones can’t afford — to make that investment,” the findings reveal. “The next round of losses occur when women leaders have to take a break when their children write board exams. There is also a break in their career, typically in their late forties when they have the responsibility of taking care of parents or in-laws. These factors have resulted in severe shortage of women who can be groomed to take on leadership roles,” says the study. It also shows that while the number of women on boards of listed companies has increased from 8% to 17%, only a handful of women directors are mostly in demand. Therefore, there is a need for more women in the leadership pipeline. In a post on X, WCD minister Smriti Irani said that “a key finding of this study is the industry leaders’ recognition of the government’s decade-long efforts to promote women in the corporate sphere and admitting that the responsibility now lies with the industry to implement measures that foster women’s leadership”. The minister added that “the study underscores the industry’s acknowledgment of gender inequality within corporations, pinpointing organisational policies, career advancement opportunities, work-life balance, and cultural norms and stereotypes as significant obstacles to be addressed”. The study recommends corporate tax reduction for companies which are doing considerable work in increasing gender diversity and incentivising women with income tax reductions.

The company has received several requests for the marker vials from other nations and expects more orders to come in over the next few months. “In the last couple of months, we have fulfilled small export orders from Cambodia, Fiji Islands, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. We are now going to process orders and repeat requirements for Mongolia, Fiji Islands, Malaysia and Cambodia,” said Irfan. Each vial costs Rs 174, an upward revision from Rs 160 in the last election. That’s because of the fluctuating price of silver nitrate, a key ingredient. The company is also exploring the option of creating marker pens to replace the glass vials containing the ink.

Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-2024-will-see-extreme-weather-events/articleshow/108253767.cms,Why 2024 will see extreme weather events,"NEW DELHI: The 2023-24 El Nino has peaked as one of the five strongest on record and will continue to impact global climate in the coming months despite a weakening trend, the World Meteorological Organisation said on Tuesday. The UN agency also said above-normal temperatures are predicted over almost all land areas between March and May. The prevailing El Nino conditions fuelled record temperatures and extreme events the world over, with 2023 being the warmest on record. Top Picks For You French lawmakers enshrine access to abortion in constitution How Pakistani, Chinese hackers tried to attack Pran Pratistha event Congress to decide on LS candidates at CEC meet on Thursday According to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global mean temperature breached the 1.5-degree Celsius threshold for an entire year for the first time in January. A permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit, specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years. In its latest update, the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) said there is about a 60 per cent chance of El Nino persisting during March-May and an 80 per cent likelihood of neutral conditions (neither El Nino nor La Nina) during April to June. There is a chance of La Nina developing later in the year but those odds are currently uncertain, it said. Scientists closely tracking the development in India have said La Nina conditions setting in by June-August could mean monsoon rains would be better this year than in 2023. El Nino -- a periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- occurs every two to seven years on an average, and typically lasts nine to 12 months. It is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia and southern Africa. ""Every month since June 2023 has set a new monthly temperature record -- and 2023 was, by far, the warmest year on record. El Nino has contributed to these record temperatures but heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit,"" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo. ""Ocean surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific clearly reflect El Nino. But sea-surface temperatures in other parts of the globe have been persistently and unusually high for the past 10 months. The January 2024 sea-surface temperature was by far the highest on record for January. This is worrying and cannot be explained by El Nino alone,"" she said. Scientists say El Nino typically has the greatest impact on the global climate in the second year of its development -- 2024, in this instance. The continuing, albeit weaker, El Nino and predicted above-normal sea-surface temperatures over much of the global oceans are expected to lead to above-normal temperatures over almost all land areas in the next three months, and influence regional rainfall patterns, according to a Global Seasonal Climate Update issued by the WMO. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January. It displayed a peak value of about 2.0 degrees Celsius above the 1991 to 2020 average sea-surface temperature for the eastern and central tropical Pacific Ocean. This made it one of the five strongest El Nino events ever, though it was weaker than the 1997-98 and 2015-2016 events. El Nino is mainly a seasonal climate phenomenon with climate impacts on seasonal climate averages but can make extreme weather and climate-events more likely in certain regions. The WMO said the seasonal forecasts are found to be more accurate during El Nino and La Nina events, particularly in the tropics, and this emphasises the pivotal role of early warnings to support decision-making and enhance preparedness and anticipatory action. ""El Nino events have a major impact on societies and economies. Accurate seasonal forecasts from the WMO community helped countries prepare in advance to try to limit the damage in climate sensitive sectors like agriculture, water resources and health. Early warnings of weather and climate extremes associated with El Nino have saved countless lives,"" said WMO's Saulo.","Mar 6, 2024, 09:36 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"

But his father detected an unusual undercurrent of anxiety . Patnibin (31), who was calling from Galilee, northern Israel, chatted to his seven-month-pregnant wife Seyona, joked with his five-year-old daughter, Amiya, and then spoke to his father, admitting that the chicken farm at Margaliot, a moshav (collective agricultural community) where he worked, was no longer safe.

Patnibin’s father, Pathrose Maxwell, revealed there had been a similar cross-border attack two weeks ago in the same locality and he had advised his son to move to a safer zone. “However, he could not as he did not get consent from his sponsor,” Pathrose told TOI. “My elder son, Nivin, who is also in Israel, called me around 4.30pm on Monday and told me that Nibin was injured in the attack and hospitalised. Later, around 12.45am, he told me that Nibin had died,” Pathrose said. Patnibin had moved to Galilee just two months ago to work on the farm on an attractive salary.

And get the response in the same language: “You don’t have to worry too much about what you eat with your medication.

You can get this by adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet! Here are some examples of what you can add: orange, mango, sweet pumpkin and carrots, guava, amla, tomato, nuts and seeds.” The Global TB (tuberculosis) Report 2022 showed that 21.4 lakh TB cases were notified in India in 2021, 18% higher than 2020. KHPT has built a digital Kannada repository in ten dialects including Mangaluru Kannada , Sirsi Kannada , Belagavi Kannada , Mandya Kannada and Ballari Kannada through an exhaustive data collection exercise. This includes data anonymised from those affected with TB, caregivers, social workers, frontline healthcare workers and communities to improve health outcomes of TB patients. KHPT and Karya interviewed 1,600 people to obtain 1,000 hours of data. They collected details on symptoms, treatment adherence, side effects, cost of treatment and benefits of the direct benefit transfer programme. “We used the automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine to capture human speech by identifying lexicon models and acoustic patterns of speech and converting it into text,” said Bisujaksha Vedantham, lead for digital transformation in KHPT. Vedantham said the pilot is currently being run in 13 districts. Mallika Biddappa Tharakan, lead - knowledge management at KHPT, said 700-800 people across these districts are covered in the initial pilot programme to check the veracity and quality of responses. “It’s not the classical medical approach, but a community-led model to understand the disease burden,” she said. For the 27-year-old Manu Chopra who co-founded Karya, the journey from growing up in a basti (informal settlement) in Delhi, to creating a business model around AI for good, has been exhilarating. The computer science student from Stanford University has roped in 100 people (50 men and 50 women) each in 10 districts across Karnataka to collect speech data for digital work related to tuberculosis using the Karya app. The Bengaluru-based startup pays these local workers minimum wages of $5 an hour, which is 20 times more than the local minimum wage. “This is pre LLM (large language model). What we used is automatic speech recognition models to finetune and streamline data tailored for TB patients and their caregivers. It’s an attempt to supplement the incomes of our community workers to create an intelligent TB knowledge repository in Kannada,” he said. Karya uses AI to empower people -- 14 million digital tasks, 35,000 workers and minimum wages of $5 an hour. It ropes in people in rural areas for digital AI work, breaking it into simple tasks including reading a sentence in their local language, or annotating an image, video, or speech. Safiya Husain, co-founder and chief impact officer at Karya, said the initial pilot underscores how the Karya app is bridging a knowledge gap and a linguistic challenge by assigning digital work, which acts as a conduit to upskill people and demonstrate pathways to create scalable impact.","Mar 6, 2024, 06:33 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"

""You abuse your right under Article 19(1)(a) (of the Constitution). You abuse your right under Article 25. Now you are exercising your right under Article 32 (to file plea in the Supreme Court)?

The Supreme Court bench was hearing a petition filed by Udhayanidhi seeking to club the FIRs registered in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka over his controversial remarks. Udhayanidhi, the son of Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, made the controversial statement during a conference in September 2023. Stalin Junior, during a meeting of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers Forum last year, asserted that ""Sanatana Dharma has to be eradicated just like mosquitoes, malaria, dengue, and corona."" 'I stand firmly by every word I have spoken,' Stalin said After the row erupted following his remarks, the Tamil Nadu minister for Youth Welfare clarified that he had not called for ""genocide"", adding that ""Uprooting Sanatana Dharma is upholding humanity and human equality."" ""I never called for the genocide of people who are following Sanatan Dharma. Sanatan Dharma is a principle that divides people in the name of caste and religion. Uprooting Sanatan Dharma is upholding humanity and human equality,"" Udhayanidhi Stalin wrote in a message on X (formally Twitter). Reiterating his statement at the 'Sanatana Abolition Conference', Udhayanidhi Stalin wrote, ""I stand firmly by every word I have spoken. I spoke on behalf of the oppressed and marginalised, who suffer due to the Sanatan Dharma."" ""I am ready to present the extensive writings of Periyar and Ambedkar, who conducted in-depth research on Sanatan Dharma and its negative impact on society in any forum,"" he added.","Mar 6, 2024, 15:34 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"

""I will be joining the BJP, possibly on March 7. I am joining the BJP as it is a national party, which is fighting against the corruption of the TMC in Bengal,"" he said. Blame on TMC? Gangopadhyay, whose rulings on various education-related matters stirred political debates, blamed Bengal’s ruling party TMC for his decision to quit judicial services and join politics. ""TMC leaders have been using derogatory language against me for quite some time. If they don't like a judgment, then they can't just verbally attack a judge. Such instigations only helped me to take the decision to join politics and fight the TMC,"" he said. ‘Told you so’ moment The speculation was doing rounds for several weeks. In fact, on January 25, Bengal’s advocate general Kishore Dutta startled many by telling Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay that he would soon join the BJP and contest the Lok Sabha election . Gangopadhyay’s tenure at the bench began in May 2018, and was due to retire in August. Run-ins with TMC As a Calcutta HC judge , several of Gangopadhyay’s rulings and observations triggered controversies for their alleged political overtones. The most controversial was a matter related to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee ’s MP nephew Abhishek Banerjee. In an unusual move for a judge, Gangopadhyay gave an interview to a Bengali news channel, criticising him while he was hearing a case in which the TMC leader was accused. The Supreme Court took cognisance and directed the Calcutta HC chief justice to reassign the matter to another judge.

There has been an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore by private space startups in the current financial year from April to Dec 2023.” “If you see the space budget alone, there is a 142% increase in the last nine years,” he said, pointing out that there has been a three-fold or more hike in related budgets like that of the department of science & technology and the department of atomic energy. Singh said out of the 424 foreign satellites launched by Isro since the 1990s, more than 90% — 389 — were launched in the last nine years. “We have so far earned $174 million from the launching of foreign satellites; out of the $174 million, as much as $157 million have been earned only in the last nine years… Out of the European satellites launched so far in the last 30 years or more than that, the total revenue generated is 256 million euros.

Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-to-protect-nri-wives-from-fraud-domestic-abuse/articleshow/108249572.cms,"How to protect NRI wives from fraud, domestic abuse","Since 2015, more than 11,000 women married to Indians abroad have approached India’s foreign missions with complaints of domestic crises. Many cases involve allegations of fraud and abuse. But in most instances, overseas officials are able to do only so much to help. That’s because there is little in Indian law that supports an intervention. However, that might change as the Law Commission has thrown its weight behind a proposal to offer legal recourse in such cases. Top Picks For You French lawmakers enshrine access to abortion in constitution How Pakistani, Chinese hackers tried to attack Pran Pratistha event Congress to decide on LS candidates at CEC meet on Thursday In its report on ‘Law on Matrimonial Issues Relating to NRIs and OCIs’ submitted last month, the Commission flags the lack of a central law to deal with NRIs. Sec.498A of IPC (cruelty by husband, in-laws) remains the only means NRI wives have of seeking action against their husbands and in-laws over domestic abuse . But the writ of Indian statutes doesn’t run in foreign jurisdictions, which are under no compulsion to deport an accused back home to face charges, the Commission says. “Problems faced by Indian wives deserted by their NRI husbands”, therefore, need a tailor-made fix, it concludes after its analysis of the Registration of Marriage of Non-Resident Indians Bill, 2019. Tabled in Rajya Sabha, the proposed legislation was referred to the Commission in April last year. Harassment, Fraud Big Issues If an NRI son-in-law is quite the sought-after match for Indian girls, a wife from back home is seen as the ideal companion for a son settled abroad. But “intercountry marriages” between NRIs or OCIs and Indian citizens have fuelled a “rapid rise in legal issues”, the Commission says. Harassment and abuse by the husband and his family, husband going incommunicado after moving overseas, failure to obtain maintenance and child support from the spouse, child custody, and request for extradition or deportation of spouse to India constitute the bulk of complaints filed by NRI wives, the govt had told Parliament in 2019. The Commission found that “deceptive practices like false assurances, misrepresentation, and abandonment are commonly associated with these fraudulent unions”. Given the stakes involved in a shift abroad, there is an element of convenience that can sometimes drive such marriages. In Punjab, for instance, it’s not uncommon to come across matrimonial ads seeking IELTS-qualified brides with the prospective groom’s family promising to foot the bill for her studies abroad; a win-win since the bride gets to earn a foreign degree and her husband hitches a ride on a dependent visa to work abroad. Pragmatic as they are, such arrangements can end in desertion and allegations of fraud. In fact, Canada recently removed dependent visas for spouses of students in undergraduate courses to check the rampant use of this route to landing abroad. What Law Commission Said The 2019 Bill deals with the registration of marriages between NRIs and Indian citizens. And while instances of aggrieved husbands knocking on court’s doors for remedy are not unknown, the proposed law and the Commission’s suggestions are geared towards addressing the issues faced by Indian wives abroad. Among the provisions discussed are the impounding of passports and the serving of e-summonses and attachment of property of “delinquent husbands”. But it begins with the need for a clear definition. To cast the net as wide as possible, the Commission says that an NRI should be defined as “a citizen of India, who resides outside lndia for any purpose whatsoever, save tourism”. Such unions should be registered within 30 days of solemnisation, in India or abroad, with travel details and overseas residential address included in the paperwork. But since storing or updating of such information is not mandated by existing Indian marriage registration laws, the Commission says a separate central NRI marriage registry be created for the purpose. It adds that a photocopy of the passport of the NRI husband “may be pasted in the marriage register... before the marriage certificate is actually issued to the parties”. It also suggests that the Passports Act, 1967, be amended to make it mandatory for holders to declare their marital status and link their passport with that of the spouse. But what about someone who is an Indian citizen at the time of marriage and then moves abroad? For that, it circles back to the need to ensure the compulsory registration of all marriages in India, whether they are performed under statutory or personal laws. As for divorce proceedings involving Indian wives abroad, it notes that if an Indian settled abroad marries in India, the marriage is to be governed by the Indian law under which they have married. If the parties have become foreign citizens and obtained a decree from a foreign court then the Indian court would apply rules of international law to decide the matter. The Commission says that the NRI marriage law should also cover aspects like child custody, rehabilitation, etc. To ensure the appearance of spouses settled abroad during court hearings, the Commission says that the provision for serving of e-summons included in the yet-to-be-notified Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS), or the new CrPC, be extended to NRIs. It also wants the provision for attachment of the property of a proclaimed offender laid down in BNSS to cover NRIs.","Mar 6, 2024, 05:23 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"

They were informed the state had moved Supreme Court against the order, and that Shahjahan could not be handed over until apex court decided the matter. Top Picks For You HC reserves judgment on ED’s Sandeshkhali case transfer plea Cops, CBI, ED... any agency can arrest Shahjahan: HC A division bench of Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya also directed Bengal govt cops to transfer all FIRs relating to Jan 5 assault on ED officers , who had gone on a raid to Shahjahan’s home in Sandeshkhali , to CBI by the same time. Accused in land grab, rape, TMC leader Shahjahan Sheikh arrested, CID probe initiated Mamata Banerjee meets PM Modi amidst row over Sandeshkhali violence, dues Controversy in West Bengal HC held it “has not only power and jurisdiction, but also an obligation to protect fundamental rights”. Soon after this order in morning, state govt moved SC, with senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi mentioning the appeal petition before Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who it was learnt, has asked state to submit relevant papers before CJI. By then, CBI officers had reached the state CID’s headquarters at Bhawani Bhawan. They were in for a long wait before CID officers told them about the state’s appeal and their inability to comply with the HC’s orders before the appeal was heard. In the meantime, ED moved in to attach Shahjahan’s assests in Sandeshkhali and Kolkata. They attached around Rs 12.7 crore worth of movable and immovable assets in Shahjahan’s and some of his associates’ name. Agency sources said that a total of 14 immovable properties — including apartments, agriculture land, land for fishery, and two bank accounts — have been attached. The HC, in its order, had noted that Shahjahan was “no ordinary citizen.” “He is an elected representative of the public, holding the highest office in a zilla parishad.... Thus, it has become imperative and absolutely necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights of the public in general,” the bench said. The division bench also set aside the single-bench order of conducting investigation by a special investigating team (SIT) comprising members of the CBI and the state police. Additional solicitor general of India SV Raju had on Monday pleaded for immediate transfer of the investigation to CBI. “The period of 15 days of police custody has started ticking. Five days have passed since the CID has taken the accused in its custody against your order of staying the SIT investigation into the case,” Raju said. He had cited a Supreme Court order, stating that an investigating agency couldn’t take an accused in custody for more than 15 days. Advocate general Kishore Datta had objected to the transfer of the investigation, citing SC rulings that stipulated that a court could transfer investigation only if there had been a complaint of bias against high state officials and police brass during the investigation. “No allegation in the FIR based on the ED complaint has been made against the state police that constitutes the fundamental ground for transfer of investigation. Neither the complainant (ED) nor the accused (Shahjahan) can have the choice of investigation,” the advocate general said. ‘We Have Obligation To protect fundamental rights The division bench on Tuesday said the state police had been “over-zealous for reasons best known to them.” The bench also noted that the circumstances under which the inspector-in-charge of Nazat PS registered an FIR, based on a complaint of Shahjahan’s security guard, Dildar Box Molla, was “clouded with suspicion for more than one reason.” The bench held the complaint was drawn on Jan 6, and the date of the complaint, written in words, prima facie “shows that there was an interpolation.” The bench agreed with deputy solicitor general Dinesh Trvedi, who had submitted on Monday how the state police “pre-timed” the FIR and tried to frustrate the investigation. “ED officers were assaulted but the first FIR lodged in Nazat PS was by Dildar Box against the ED officers was at 10.30am. The scribe to this complaint by Box is a high court advocate. If the accused had made this advocate write the complaint, then the advocate should have reached Sandeshkhali much before 10am, knowing that the ED team was coming for the raid,” Trivedi had submitted. The bench also noted that Section 307 of the IPC (attempt to murder) was added to the FIR 12 days days after the FIR was lodged.","Mar 6, 2024, 10:11 IST","Mar 06, 2024, 17:09 IST"
